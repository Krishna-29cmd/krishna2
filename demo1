Adding two numbers in Python can be achieved using the arithmetic addition operator +. 
Method 1: Direct Addition 
This method involves directly adding two numerical values and storing the result in a variable or printing it directly. 
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
result = num1 + num2
print(result)  # Output: 8

Method 2: User Input 
This method allows the user to input the numbers during program execution. The input() function reads the input as a string, so it needs to be converted to an integer using int() before addition. 
fnum = int(input("Enter first number: "))
snum = int(input("Enter second number: "))
sum_of_numbers = fnum + snum
print("The sum of", fnum, "and", snum, "is", sum_of_numbers)

Method 3: Using a Function 
For more organized and reusable code, you can define a function to perform the addition. 
def add_numbers(a, b):
  return a + b

number1 = 10
number2 = 7
sum_result = add_numbers(number1, number2)
print("The sum is:", sum_result) # Output: The sum is: 17
